        <p>Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau. There, legend says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these beloved beans.  </p>
        <p>The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from a certain tree, his goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night. </p>
       <p>Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the berries and found that it kept him alert through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his discovery with the other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to spread.</p>
       <p>As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian peninsula, it began a journey which would bring these beans across the globe.</p>

        <p>Let's see how to froth milk for latte art.</p>
        <ol>
         <li>Make espresso shots.</li>
         <li>Fill pitcher with cold milk to the bottom of pour spout dent.</li>
         <li>Aerate milk for about 3 seconds by keeping the tip of the wand near the surface of the milk. You should hear a paper-tearing sound.</li>
         <li>Submerge wand toward bottom of pitcher to get milk to spin in a whirlpool motion. Make sure the wand is in the middle of the pitcher to help swirl the milk completely.</li>
         <li>Heat milk to 150°F. Use a thermometer, or stop when you can’t touch the pitcher for more than an instant.
